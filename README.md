# Custom Scroll Indicator

Project 9 of the freeCodeCamp 25 React Projects for interview.

This project is designed to fetch and display products from a given URL while visually tracking the user's scroll progress on the page. It comprises the following functionalities:

- Data Fetching: Utilizes the fetch API to retrieve product data from the specified URL. This data is stored in the component's state.

- Loading and Error Handling: Manages loading states and error messages to provide user feedback during the data fetching process.

- Scroll Tracking: Calculates and displays the user's scroll progress as a horizontal progress bar at the top of the page.

- Dynamic Rendering: Conditionally renders a list of products if data is successfully fetched, or displays loading and error messages as appropriate.
